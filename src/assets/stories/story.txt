You Said Your Behaviour Wasn’t Something Someone Could Love… But I Loved You Anyway
We first met back in 9th grade. I don’t even remember exactly how our first conversation started, but it happened online. Maybe it was fate, maybe just coincidence — but whatever it was, I couldn’t have stopped it, even if I wanted to. At the time, I didn’t realise it would become one of the best parts of my life.

Those online chats felt like stepping into a hallway where time slowed down. Typed words, a blinking cursor, the small thrill of seeing you “typing...” — it all felt like a little world where we could just be ourselves. I’d rehearse what to say and then forget it all when your message arrived, because your replies always felt warmer and more spontaneous than anything I could plan.

We talked almost every day online, but I never had the courage to speak to you face-to-face. Then one day, I happened to come meet you in person, for a game. You looked at me and said, “So this is the guy who talks so much online?” That was the first time we actually spoke in person, and something in me shifted.

I remember noticing things that don’t show up in chats — the way your smile landed just a second before your laugh, the easy confidence in your posture, the light in your eyes when you teased me. It was like discovering a favorite song sounded even better outside the headphones, carried by the air around us.

After that, we started meeting for morning cycling. Maybe for you it was just a normal routine, but for me… those moments were precious. Eventually, I told you that I liked you. You replied that you weren’t interested in such things at that time, and I respected that. I didn’t push. We kept talking anyway — mornings, evenings, sometimes playing games late at night, sometimes walking together after school.

Those mornings still live with me — the cool air against our faces, dew on the grass, the steady click of the chain as the road unspooled ahead. Sometimes we spoke about nothing; sometimes we said even less and somehow it was more. Your laugh would carry in the quiet, and my heart would do that small, helpless thing it always did around you.

I still remember when you had tuition at Mecon. Once, when I dropped you there, you said I’d also have to come and pick you up. You had that small button phone back then, and we used to talk late at night. Once my WiFi ran out, and I couldn’t talk to you until it got recharged — and that night, we spoke for hours. It might seem small, but for me, it meant a lot.

I can still hear the soft click of your keypad through the call, the faint rustle as you shifted, the way you’d go quiet for a second when you were thinking. I remember watching the recharge timer like a countdown back to the world where your voice existed. When it worked again, it felt like the lights came back on.

We were playing a game one night when you suddenly said “I like you.” I couldn’t hear it properly because of the noise, but later in the chat, when I asked what you’d said, you told me. Then you quickly added, “But as a friend.” It didn’t change much on the surface, but I still remember exactly how I felt.

Things went on like that — cycling, games, calls, late-night talks. I miss it even now as I write this. But life took its turn, and suddenly everything ended. By 10th grade, things between us had started to break down. At first, I didn’t feel it as much, but as days passed, I began to miss you more and more. I’d remember the smallest moments, and they’d hit me harder each time.

Maybe it was the weight of exams, new schedules, the way people drift without meaning to. Seasons changed, and so did we. The messages slowed, the calls grew shorter. I kept looking for the right time to bridge the gap, but time kept walking ahead without me.

I even tried to reach out again. I contacted Mahi, thinking maybe she could say something to bring us back to talking. But by then, she was talking to him. They were having their own conversations, and he already knew how I had spent four years thinking about you, how I had lived through it all. Mahi told him things about you that weren’t true, and he told me. I believed him, and when I came to you with those stories, hoping for clarity, it backfired completely. I became the bad guy.

I wish I had chosen silence. I wish I had trusted what I felt instead of what I heard. If I caused you hurt by bringing you stories that weren’t mine to carry, I’m sorry. None of it was ever to corner you or prove a point. I only ever wanted one thing: for us to speak honestly, like we used to.

After that, I gave up hope. I found a new friend, and we talked a lot, but it wasn’t the same. I confessed to him that I had made mistakes and that I regretted them. I told him about you and how much you meant to me. He understood, but life kept moving forward without you in it.

In the quiet that followed, I learned to sit with what I felt. Not to fight it, not to bury it — just to let it be there. Some evenings, I’d take the long way home and try to remember your voice exactly.

Even now, I sometimes look up at the sky and think, If I could just meet her once more, I’d be willing to do anything she asked — quit my business, focus on studies, anything. That’s how much I was ready to give. But eventually, I accepted that maybe we were never meant to meet again.

On some days the sky is a calm blue, on others it’s heavy with rain, or quiet with drifting clouds. I’ve found a strange comfort there — in the way weather changes and still the world keeps moving. It reminds me that love can be steady even when circumstances aren’t.

Since loving you, I’ve searched for pieces of you in every girl I’ve met. But no one has been even close. I’ve grown tired, worn out. I don’t think I can fall in love again. I won’t get married, and if my parents try to force me, I’ll refuse. It may take time, but they’ll eventually understand.

Maybe that’s just another way of saying that what I felt for you wasn’t a phase — it was home. And even if life takes us to different cities, different stories, I will always be grateful that, for a while, my path ran close to yours. You taught me what it means to care without asking for anything back. That lesson will stay with me, always.
